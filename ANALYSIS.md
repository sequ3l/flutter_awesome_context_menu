```

The package includes a comprehensive example app (`example/`) that demonstrates various use cases and features.

## Core Components

### AwesomeContextMenuArea
This is the main widget that wraps content with context menu functionality. It detects right-clicks (or long-presses on mobile) and displays the context menu. Key features include:
- Customizable menu items
- Link handling support
- Mouse event handling (enter, exit, hover, move)
- CTRL+Click support for links
- Custom positioning of menus
- Optimized event handling with timestamp throttling to prevent flickering

### AwesomeContextMenuItem
Represents individual menu items within the context menu. Features include:
- Text label and optional icon
- Optional keyboard shortcut text
- Enabled/disabled state
- Hierarchical support for nested submenus
- Configurable interaction modes (hover, click, long-press)
- Option to keep menus open after selection

### AwesomeContextMenu
Core utility class for programmatically showing, updating, and hiding context menus. Provides static methods for menu management independent of the AwesomeContextMenuArea widget.

### Supporting Utilities
- **AwesomeLinkHandler**: Manages URL-related operations like opening in new tabs and clipboard copying
- **AwesomePlatformUtils**: Handles platform detection and provides platform-specific behaviors
- **AwesomeMenuItemCache**: Optimizes performance by caching frequently used menu items and icons

## Key Features

### Platform Adaptability
- Right-click detection for desktop and web platforms
- Long-press support for mobile platforms
- Platform-adaptive submenu interaction (hover on desktop, click/tap on mobile)

### Rich Customization Options
- Custom menu items with icons and keyboard shortcuts
- Hierarchical/nested submenus up to multiple levels
- Theme-aware styling that adapts to app themes
- Custom positioning of menus
- Customizable animation settings

### Interactive Features
- Form elements within menus (text fields, sliders, etc.)
- Persistent menu items that don't dismiss the menu when selected
- Dynamic menu item generation based on context
- Mouse event handling (click, hover, enter, exit)

### Performance Optimizations
- Menu item caching to improve performance
- Efficient overlay management
- Timestamp-based event throttling to prevent duplicate context menu events
- Smart delay sequencing for menu hide/show operations
- **Advanced memory management** with instance-level resource tracking
- **Position calculation caching** for complex submenu hierarchies
- **Intelligent state management** to minimize unnecessary widget rebuilds
- **LRU cache optimization** with time-based expiration and configurable limits

## Architectural Improvements (v0.0.9)
### Memory Management
- **Instance-level overlay tracking**: Eliminated global static variables that caused memory leaks
- **Automatic resource cleanup**: Enhanced dispose methods with comprehensive resource management
- **Animation lifecycle management**: Proper cleanup of animation controllers with race condition prevention
- **Timer resource management**: Automatic cleanup of background timers and processes

### Concurrency Control
- **Pointer ID-based event tracking**: Replaced global flags with per-event tracking to prevent interference
- **Operation-in-progress prevention**: Added mutex-like protection for concurrent menu operations
- **Enhanced event throttling**: Timestamp-based deduplication with configurable timing windows
- **Race condition elimination**: Comprehensive protection against rapid menu show/hide operations

### Error Resilience
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for network operations and system interactions
- **URL validation**: Robust parsing and validation with proper error reporting
- **Null safety improvements**: Enhanced null checking with retry mechanisms for render operations
- **Debug-friendly logging**: Improved error messages and debugging information

### Accessibility Enhancements
- **Screen reader support**: Semantic widgets throughout the menu system
- **Keyboard navigation**: Enhanced focus management and navigation paths
- **Assistive technology integration**: Proper labels and hints for complex menu structures
- **Platform-adaptive accessibility**: Different interaction models for different platforms

## Integration Points
The package integrates with:
- **url_launcher**: For handling link operations (opening URLs, etc.)
- **Flutter's mouse/pointer event system**: For detecting right-clicks and other mouse events
- **Flutter's overlay system**: For displaying context menus as overlays

## Platform Support
- **Full Support**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Web
- **Partial Support**: Android, iOS (via long-press)

## Extensibility
The package is designed with extensibility in mind:
- Custom menu builders for completely custom menu UIs
- Hook points for different interaction events
- Configurable behaviors for different platforms

## Dependencies
- **flutter**: Core Flutter framework
- **url_launcher**: For handling URL operations
